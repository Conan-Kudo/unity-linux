Hello All,
After many attempts in the last few months and even some non attempts, I was able to port rpm5 to a MUSL-libc based Distribution called Alpine Linux. From that point I was able to rebuild a majority of the packages needed for a working system based on MUSL. I have adopted some of the applications scripts and technics Alpine uses as they seem to have a handle on a very usable MUSL based distribrution and what I have ended up creating, was some sort of strange mixture of Fedora/Mandriva and Alpine. There's still much more work to do.
