To add a file or folder to be backed up, lbu include /path/to/foo
To remove a file from being backed up, lbu exclude /path/to/foo
To setup LBU options, edit /etc/lbu/lbu.conf
To create a package as specified in lbu.conf, lbu commit
To override destination of the backup package, lbu package /path/to/bar.apkovl.tar.gz
